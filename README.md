<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project
<br />

2025 Oct 3
Hii!! This is my github page for my godot game Fatty Frog. Fatty Frog is my first game and was originally made for the YSWS program Shiba. It's a 2D puzzle platformer game where you jump left and right instead of having 3 buttons(up, left, right) compared to many other platformers. I wanted to experiment with two-key movement and while making it more puzzel-like than the usual platformers, like Knight Errant. I made it by following Brackey's beginner tutorial and then branching out with my own ideas by following more tutorials😅. I've also added some of my own assets(The tileset looks horrible). The game is still in development but expect new mechanics !!! :D

Lore:
You are Fatty Frog, the leader of the army(group of frogs), admired for your large size. However, after a lengthy winter slumber, you awoke to find that you are no longer overweight. Soooo venture out and consume enough Fatty Flies to regain your esteemed status!


Struggles: 
-enemy movement and code

-spawning enemies(yeah it's not here yet)

-how do you receive signals

-how to make a good level that's challenging but is impossible for player to get permanently stuck

-how to come up with an original idea

Result: And now I now how to do these things lol

play here: https://zoeyao.itch.io/fatty-frog

### Built Using
I used the Ouch! CLI tool for decompression of files <br />
This project was built using one simple, yet powerful language.<br />
It required a lot of workarounds, but it was a pleasure to use it
